<p>Hello my name is Adina, I have 26 years old and I am a software developer. Right now I 
  work with Progress Openedge for 6 years. I started to learn a bit of Web development by taking the\
  The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp course and this website is the result of this course.
</p>

<p>I have a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science which I obtain in 2019 after graduating the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer
  Science from University of Bucharest. My final project was a mobile application similar to GoodReads developed with Java.
  I also have a Master's Degree in Databases and Software technologies. This one was obtained in 2021 after graduating the Faculty of 
  Mathematics and Computer Science from University of Bucharest. The final project was a website were you could make appointments to 
  different beauty saloons. This was developed with Java, Spring, Hibernate and also a bit of HTML and Javascript.

<p>In my free time I like to learn new things, that's why I started this course. I also like going to the gym, reading, whatching TV series,
  trying new restaurants and food.
